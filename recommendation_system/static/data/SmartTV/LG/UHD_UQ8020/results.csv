Initially I was planning to buy LG 7500 series which was price less than the LG7720...but as per the review from others it seems that LG7500 series has VA panel. As my room is wide and we do watch tv from side as well...so I planned to buy LG7720 series.which has IPS panel...but it is not mentioned on the LG website...and I'm happy to buy it..great viewing angle..the AI settings are good for both video and audio quality...no need to buy any external speaker...if you feel low with audio just g...READ MORE,positive

"Been using it for 2 months,When you get it, First set the picture mode to vivid and reduce Sharpness to 20-23. Best ips display ever, far better than any va panel. Go for it blindly.Cons: the only con is the web os, you won't have the freedom of Android . But it can be solved with any Chromecast device if that's your thing. Everything else is perfect about this tv . The panel is better than perfect. Love it, even 360p videos are upscaled awesome. But that picture settings Tweak is nec...READ MORE",positive

"55"" TV is value for money after 1 month of my research and got it for 55k after all discount, and satisfied with my TV till now after 10 days of usage but installation is worst part coz service engineer from Sai electro craft, Dindigul came and fixed the Wall mount which is not able to move front and back and the main thing is,he doesn't fix the upper bolt properly which is very loose as if it will fall down at any time, and I asked him to fix the bolt right and he neglected and told it won't...READ MORE",negative
2 day delivery and same day installation.Awesome video and audio quality - much better vs a standard 20w sound. IPS panel. UI experience is different vs Android due to WebOS but it is smooth and contains majority of the important apps so there shouldn't be a problem. Comes with a magic remote. I've not heard of any difference between the offline models UQ8040/UQ8050 vs UQ8020 so do not get confused with the different model namesREAD MORE,positive
"Picture quality is really great for viewing Full HD and 4K content. But the sound quality is not that good, should say just average. I am thinking of getting a sound bar for that. For the installation part I would suggest future buyers to set the tv at a lower height, i.e. when you are seated the centre of the tv should be at your eye level. Given that it has quite a big screen size (55 inches), the experience will be better if the tv is set right at that level.READ MORE",negative

1 star less for the damaged TV I recieved by the seller and installation delays. The product itself is great. It really has stunning picture quality but sound is muffled. It gives crisp voice but struggles to keep mid tones. The bass is okay. You definitely need a soundbar to get good sound quality.Display : 5/5Sound : 2.5/5Software : 4/5READ MORE,negative

The side angle view of this tv is very bad for this online model lg uq8020 psb. I think this is the major difference between online (lg uq8020PSB) and offline models like lg uq8040 and lg uq8050. In lg uq8020 model there is a va panel in place of ips.Be careful during purchase.READ MORE,negative

First of all it‚Äôs not an LED TV it‚Äôs LCD TV and LG is branding it as LED TV. Second if you want to view the Tv from side angles you won‚Äôt get any clear picture view the TV doesn‚Äôt support side views 179 degree view. The screen is LCD and it bleeds in dark scenes so I would not recommend it to buy to anyone instead go for Sony TVs or Samsung TVS for better experience. Also it‚Äôs cost is so highREAD MORE,negative
