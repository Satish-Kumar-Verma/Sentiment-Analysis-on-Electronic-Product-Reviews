Picture quality is excellentColors ar natural and not so vibrant. Color temperature is really controlled well.Settings of audio and video has several modes of your choice. I really soke the cinema mode audio. It creates very lod and clear sounds for movies and music.Speakers are so loud that you might not need home theatre.I tried it with Wifi connecting to Airtel Xtreme fiber. It runs buttery smooth.Also I tried it with HD channels on Airtel DTH. The quality of picture and audio is ex...READ MORE,positive

"Sony, LG and Samsung are the 3 brands which anyone can trust for their picture quality and overall trust people have on these brands. No other chinese brands are in competition with these 3 brands.LG UQ7500 is an upgraded version of UP7500 which came last year. This model has an IPS panel with picture quality being top notch as expected from an ips panel. WebOS is a little limited when compared to google OS and in terms of usage but i am fine with it.

If you want better picture quality then this is not right for you. I don‚Äôt know whether I only observed this is there someone also observed but not given review. The panel of this tv is VA panel which is hidden by LG as well as Flipkart. If you see at 90 degrees then only this tv looks ok. If you deviate little bit 10 degrees away from tv you will lot of white shade entire tv looks so whitish and it is not even comparable by normal Full HD tv‚Äôs. Such a worst product.

There is difference in opinion about its panel type. Whether it is VA or IPS? LG has not yet revealed about panel type. Viewing angle is not like 178 deg. Magic remote has not been provided thats why we cannot use Alexa and Google voice assistant. You have to purchase magic remote. We can give voice commands through  LG thinq app downloaded in your smart phone but voice recognition is very poor. Compatible magic remote for TV model is not available in India.

Does not support JIO cinema App! Can't watch World CupIts surprising JIO cinema App is not supported on LG webOS especially when FIFA world cup 2022 is exclusively available only on Jio app.LG should have taken steps to provide popular apps rather than many useless apps on their store.
