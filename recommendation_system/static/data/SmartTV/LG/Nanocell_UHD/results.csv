Mind Blowing Picture Quality..READ MORE,positive
"Great picture quality, very Crips and crystal clear., sound quality is good but it's not adequate for living room of size 10x17, probably will need soundbar for it. WebOS is good, it's bit slow but it's almost same for other os as well. Having some issue connecting via airplay to MacBook, will need to troubleshoot it. Screencast works seemlessly. Screen viewing angle is awesome, there is very slight color change when we see from sideways (>170 viewing angle)READ MORE",positive

"Writting this review after 3 month of use. The product is worth the price I bought at. Picture quality is pretty neat, though sound is lower as compared to its counter part from SONY.LG store is a good platform for app download. AI feature is a good one. The smart remote with cursor feature is pretty handy to use once you are habitual with it. The product has almost all the features of a SMART television.Overall satisfied and worth recommending.READ MORE",positive
Really happy with the purchase. Packaging was great and it came on time. LG service person contacted at the same day and installed the wall mount.Clarity is way better than regular 4K TVs. Smart features are nice and has enough storage for new apps. New smart remote is really nice and thinner than the previous one.Overall a great product. Go for it.READ MORE,positive
"Picture quality is awesome.Dolby Atmos: Supported by external atmos speakers through hdmi eArc port(hdmi 2)Netflix: 4k,UHD,HDR unlocked expect dolby vision but this tv does not need dolby vision at all.

"Great product. Better picture quality than UHD. I have Lg OLED tv also. Nanocell is nowhere close to OLED. But Nanocell is far better than UHD. Sound quality is perfect. Overall a happy purchase, go for it.READ MORE",positive

I'll be straight to the point. All of us are here for a good and value for money option. So if you are looking for a 4k smart TV with the given specification. Look no further. Superb picture clarity and I mean smashing. Great connectivity option and smooth mirror casting with the applicable application.Even though the TV's price wad 49k. I got it for 43k and I'll suggest you guys to wait for such an opportunity because at that price range you won't get much better TV. LG are the market leade...READ MORE,positive
"Hope, this 2021 model display is not IPS panel, Viewing angle worst, u have to watch straight 90 degree to get colour / clarity. First time very bad experience with LG.Otherwise Connectivity and audio is better.READ MORE",negative
Display is good but sound quality is average and ok ok. You might need a home theatre speaker system or a sound bar to attach to it for better sound quality. Delivery and installation was perfect.Some apps are not available on WebOS so that is a negative. LG must get the missing popular apps soon on WebOS so that we do not need to arrange for any external device for the missing OTT apps.READ MORE,negative
This model tv very good product thanks to LG and FlipkartREAD MORE,positive
Good picture quality but the problem is  viewing angle  It is not upto the mark If you watch from a side everything looks over brightREAD MORE,negative
Value for MoneyClear picture. If you are looking between LG UP8000 Vs Nano pls go for Nano. Loud Sound no need of sound bar. I am running with 25% of volume Clear picture viewing angle is good Installation I had to follow with LG. Suggest others to call LG. Installation I'll be Done within a dayREAD MORE,positive

"Cheap quality panels , only single person sitting exact front can see true colors and other sitting next need to buy another TV , it's a big manufacturing blunder from LG for this model. Poor Picture processing 4K is a dream this TV is only good for SD Quality pictures.People using SD set top box of free dish box will not see any issue with TV.READ MORE",negative
"It‚Äôs a below average product in the name of Nanocell, I made a mistake of going with brand and the so-called claims that the product is close to OLED based on some propriety technology.I was not convinced with WebOS at the first place compared to android yet went ahead with it on the false claims of picture quality of Nanocell.Multiple issues, its not an IPS panel that is provided on 55-inch, brightness levels are too poor for the TV to be used in a room with window.The colour reproduction...READ MORE",negative

"Wanted to change my 13 years old LCD. Went through numerous articles on types of TVs and reviews on Flipkart. Chose LG NanoCell over other brands for following reasons:1. Brand value, LG is known for quality products.2. NanoCell is more advanced technology than 4k UHD TVs available in the market.3. Fits into the budget.4. Picture quality is good.5. Sound quality is good but haven't used it much as mine is connected to a soundbar via eARC HDMI available in the TV.6. Installation was time...READ MORE",positive
