Very good led.Display and sound excellent. Very good viewing angle.I am happy with this tv.Magic remote feature is very good.Hindi AI not recognize in this tv for searching YouTube video.Only problem is that there is some gap between panel and frame so dust will enter in pannel corners.READ MORE,positive
