This is sub standard TV. I have TCL TV purchased last yr. With same confirmation and clearly TCL is much much better. Drawback..1. Slow connectivity via wifi2. USB. No last memory. Every time ull have forward which is very very slow3. Picture clarity stands no where when compared with TCL4. Screen cast/ mirroring is pathetic. It just keeps hanging.Overall... its frustrating experience. Go for TCL instead of One+READ MORE,negative

Thank you Flipkart for delivering tv in this situation just within 2 days and one thing that surprised me was installation within 4 hours. I was extremely mind blown with the service in got. I had uninstalled flipkart as I was not happy with it 4 years ago but reinstalling and trying it again was worth it.Another Great news is NO cost EMI upto 9 months from Flipkart on purchase of TV. This is just Wowww!!! Thanks to the delivery agent and installation guy who did thier job flawlessly.READ MORE,negative
