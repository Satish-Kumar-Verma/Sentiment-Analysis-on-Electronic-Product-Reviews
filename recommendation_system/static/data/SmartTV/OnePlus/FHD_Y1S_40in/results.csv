Generally 1plus is a good brand but even at a price of 16k OnePlus cannot afford to give such third grade products. Probably they should take this product off from circulation. Such pathetic was the quality of this particular product. Am not sure about how is the performance of higher end products in OnePlus but this definitely is not something to consider at all.READ MORE,negative

"First things first, I have purchased OP Y 43-inches smart TV @ 24K- it's a great deal for me. Apart from it, this TV is one of the best smart TV's out there in the market that you can get. The User Interface is clean and doesn't lags while operating the tv. Also, the picture quality is up to my expectations. The after-sales is also great. I got my TV installed by a guy named Sonu from Jeeves. He was highly professional and explained all the features of the TV.READ MORE",positive
