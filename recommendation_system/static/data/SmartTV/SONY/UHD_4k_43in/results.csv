"Amazing product. Picture quality of Sony TVs are unbeatable. Sound could have been crispier though. The only con I could find is that the 5Ghz band is not powerful enough. It could not pickup a 5Ghz signal even though the router is not far away. But 2.4Ghz works absolutely fine! Again, the panel quality is top notch.READ MORE",positive

"Just love with the picture quality and sounds. its just 24 hours I am using this TV, love the picture quality but for Netflix, Prime Video content while playing the previews the sound is good but while started watching the full content then the sound is very low and bass is some how missing. We need little bit of bass while throwing the dialogue.READ MORE",negative
