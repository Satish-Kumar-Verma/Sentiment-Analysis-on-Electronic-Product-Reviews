PerfectionThis is a 50inch model1.Colours are the most accurate in this range(you can customize their saturation and make it look like a samsung tv if you want)2.You should see their Motionflow XR feature in person. It can be your only reason to buy this TV3.Google TV is way better than their android interface4.The most underated feature which I think people don't often talk about is this tv's ability to UPSCALE. My god 1080p looks just as good as 4k. No other brand/tv in this range (bef...READ MORE,positive

"Overall the TV is good. The reason for 4 stars is, At 45k rupees, Sony is giving a realtek processor with 1.4ghz clock speed and 2 GB Ram. Out of which only 450mb ram is free. It comes with 16gb storage but usable is around 7gb. Lots of system apps are there, which are hidden in menu like playstore and gallary. The processor is entry level which is equal to a 15k rupees tv like one plus y1s. The GPU is g31 which is also entry level GPU, found in mi TV's as well. With such basic har...READ MORE",positive
