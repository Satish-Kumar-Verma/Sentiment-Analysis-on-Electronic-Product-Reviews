"Crystal clear picture quality and the colours feel so natural. This is what Sony TV's are meant for. Sound quality is absolutely perfect with noticable bass. Obviously you won't get that extreme bass. To enjoy quality picture via STB, a HD subscription is must. A must buy affordable quality product.READ MORE",positive

"I think product quality and packing are really very good. I also think this product is worth the cost.Although I feel the product (TV) is processing is a little slow. I mean as in today's world commands given by remote can process a little faster. For example, when I press Youtube it shows processing.I am surprised to see the product manual, why Sony makes it so complicated. It's really ridiculous that the product manual is more complicated than the product itself.READ MORE",positive

The Tv is just excellent. I am always a fan of sony company especially in terms of TV. The picture quality of this TV is just awesome.

"Product is good, and most importantly the delivery, setup by the sony technician before time was so good. We bought this for our aged parents as a surprise gift. Obviously they cant set up the TV by themselves and was dependent on the SONY technicians visit. As per the initial plan they were supposed to setup it up after 3 days of the delivery. But surprisingly they came the very next day and have set it up. Thank you team. Coming to the TV by itself, so far so good. Will update more after s...READ MORE",positive
