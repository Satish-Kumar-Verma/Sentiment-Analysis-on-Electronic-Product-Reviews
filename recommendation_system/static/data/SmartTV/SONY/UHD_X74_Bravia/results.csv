"The TV is excellent- image, sound quality and the software is topnotch. Flipkart's updates on every step of the delivery was very helpful and on time.The only issue is the Sony Installation process.

"I'm writing this review after one month of usage. First I'll say this TV is awesome for this price range. Picture quality is superb, sound quality is very good we can't imagine 20w speakers produce this much of quality sound, no connectivity issues, tv runs very smoothly,  Only one con some times tv is lagging Sony should give update for this issue. So it's a must buy TV.READ MORE",positive
