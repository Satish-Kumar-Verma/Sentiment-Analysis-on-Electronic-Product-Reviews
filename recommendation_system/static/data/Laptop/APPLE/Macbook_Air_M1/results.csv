"Value for money product...But no one said this major issue on every mac. If I touch or rub the mac body while charging, I can feel some electric sensation passing through my body.. when I searched about the issue, this issue has existed for the last 10 years on all mac devices because of 2 pin chargers without ground. This issue can be resolved only with a 3 pin charger with ground. This issue should be resolved by mac providing 3 pin charger but they didn't care about this issue. We should...READ MORE",negative

"I am glad that I chose Flipkart for this purchase as I got the HDFC discount. I am more than happy that I chose the space grey color as it looks fabulous. Performance, camera, battery, quality etc. are all of top quality and hence no doubt. Macbook Air M1 chip is definitely a better choice compared to Macbook Pro. Just go and get your MacBook!üôÇREAD MORE",positive

"Great laptop for someone who is a FIRST TIME APPLE user. Connectivity is nice and security is awesome. The ability to MULTITASK is the speciality of this laptop. It doesn't matter if this the base variant. I had no problem running PHOTOSHOP, ADOBE XD, FIGMA, PREMIER RUSH, and FLUTTER as well. This laptop can survive all the heavy open at the same time. So good at handling at these tasks. And when ever i use this for browsing only, the BATTERY LIFE would be beyond compare. I would go on for 4 ...READ MORE",positive

"Have been using it for past 6-7 months for software development purposes pretty much Android and iOS development and some server maintenance and backend work as well and let me tell it handles everything like a charm. The battery lasts for about 8-9 hours on a full charge with about 70 percent brightness, it you are into software development just go for it you won't regret this purchase.READ MORE",positive
Battery and performance is terrific. Been using it for last 2 days on and off and 30% battery time is still left. Once charged 100% can go for 12-13 hours. M1 chip is crazy smooth and fast. Display is also 10/10. Almost same performance as MacBook pro apart from some obvious differences. You can go for it if your requirements are not too much.READ MORE,positive
