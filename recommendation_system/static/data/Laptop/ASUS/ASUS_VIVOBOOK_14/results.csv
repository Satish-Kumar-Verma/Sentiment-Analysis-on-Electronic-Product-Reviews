Really So nice laptop. Bulid quality is good. Touch is so smooth workingREAD MORE,positive
"Initial Impression - The built quality is good and appears to be sturdy . Keypad is ergonomically designed and of good quality.  Touch screen is responsive.Cons Battery backup is not so great. The biggest dampner is not providing backlit keyboard. During charging, the laptop did appear slightly warm. At this price, it appears to bit over priced.READ MORE",negative

Good quality but battery performance low.READ MORE,negative
Overall a good laptop under 45k.Display is good. Battery is okay. Design is excellent. Compact and easy to carry. Performance is good for normal usage. You can't play games in higher settings. Ryzen 5 5500U is better for gaming in this price range.READ MORE,positive
