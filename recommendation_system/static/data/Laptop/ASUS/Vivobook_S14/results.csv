"I recently purchased the ASUS Vivobook S14 Intel EVO H-Series Core i5 12th Gen laptop, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. From its stellar performance to its sleek design, this laptop ticks all the boxes for a great computing experience.First and foremost, the specifications of this laptop are impressive. With 8 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD, it offers smooth multitasking and ample storage space. Windows 11 is pre-installed, providing a seamless and modern operating system. The I...READ MORE",positive

"The Pros:In this price range, this is probably the only notebook with an evo certification. Therefore along with really good design and form factor, the display is equally good, resolution, brightness and colours are on point.The battery is better than other laptops in this range (70whr vs 40-45 whr). Processor's good but has an evident heating problem, although its bearable for the performance.Touchpad's huge but misses out on accuracy sometimes. (same with the fingerprint sensor).

"In 50k it's one of the best laptops. It is worth buying 48k to 58k by online shopping.If you have already used some high end laptops then you will be a little bit disappointed.The display is good but you can easily understand it's not oled but  for programming and reading it's better than OLED.For build quality I am much more satisfied than my professional laptop.The battery is satisfactory, you need to change a few settings to take 9 to 10 hours (as per evo suggest settings) of battery b...READ MORE",positive

"Best one for the personal and office use. Battery life is good. Who are looking for gaming, editing and coding is very perfect one. Metal finish looks good and provide stickers as well. BlackyyyyyREAD MORE",positive
"All in all a very good product. Value for money as I bought for 56k. No compromises from performance and build sides. However, I have been having issues related to Bluetooth connectivity with audio devices like TWS or Speakers. The reason might be on the OS side or driver side, I have checked it as of yet. But in general a very good product. Recommended if you don't have much gaming to do or heavy graphical software to use. üëçüèªREAD MORE",positive

The battery was as expected.And also the charging port is thunderbolt 4, which is super speed.Con :-Display is  above average, as it will only support 1080p not more thana that.Sound quality by Harman, is not that much expected.

"The laptop is a beast if you get it under 50k. It's EVO certified so no compromise in the performance part. The display is good ( 4 out of 5 ). The build quality is good too. The only issue is the speaker, it's too low and not usable even if you are in a room with people around you ( 1 out of 5, it's that bad ) but we can arrange speakers for that. Still its a value for money at 49k ( that's the deal I got it )READ MORE",negative
