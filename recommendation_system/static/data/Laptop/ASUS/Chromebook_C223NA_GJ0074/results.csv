"I have been using Chromebook for almost 10 years. Before buying this, we imported from USA. This is excellent for kids. It's way better than tablet. Good build quality. As usual chrome OS is lag free. Since chrome os is extremely light weight when compared to windows. So even on low processor you can get lag free experience. Now this Chromebook is supporting all android apps, so it's extremely powerful machine for this price range. For Rs.999 you will get 3 complete protection. This i...READ MORE",positive

"Nice product. good for online classes and basic stuff like surfing, online videos etc.  value for money if you get under 17K after card discount. Highly recommended over tablets and large screen mobile. Go for it without any second thought. I observed 3-4 times that it hangs if you use while charging. Not observed normally.READ MORE",positive

"I bought it yesterday, one thing I can say for sure that its battery backup is amazing and its best for daily usage and its strictly not for heavy usage. If your whole work system is based on google, then it works perfectly fine. In windows os, battery drains faster, but in chrome os, it works charm.READ MORE",positive

"Please note that this laptop is for extremely basic usage like YouTube, basic word processing using Google docs etc. If that's what you need then this laptop is for you... It's best feature is it's battery life which can easily stretch to nearly 6 hours plus. It also has Android apps but the implementation is kind of awkward and unevenREAD MORE",negative
"Value for money. With android and Linux apps support, Chrome OS is better than ever. I've been using a different Asus chromebook for past 3 years and I could always depend on it whether it is for speed, reliability, or battery backup. I would always choose a mini laptop over tablet.Reasons for not giving 5 stars for this model:* Only 3 years support (end of life: June 2024). Reinstalling a different OS (Linux) is not straightforward and using outdated Chrome OS is not recommended* I notic...READ MORE",negative
"awesome product, though serious laptop users are going to be dissapointed, mostly for online classes, meeting or for very light work, as it runs on chrome OS most of the software that we are familiar with do not work on this Chromebook....and only android apps that can be stored are from google app store only, outside that the the apps with apk are not supported..READ MORE",positive

"Ideal for your small needs at a low price. One drawback is that the screen is small, but you can rest assured that the price is low. Works with focus on Google Chrome. So the tea you get on the tester or laptop when using other browsers Features not available. This is similar to what a typical mobile browsing application looks like when set to desktop modeREAD MORE",positive
