"I have been using this laptop for a week now, and it has surpassed my expectations in many ways. One aspect that has impressed me is its incredibly fast startup time, taking only 5-7 seconds, while the shutdown time is equally remarkable at just 2-3 seconds. Another great feature is that it comes pre-installed with the latest version of Windows, Windows 11, and MS Office 2021, ensuring that I have the most up-to-date software to enhance my overall productivity.Including a fingerprint sensor...READ MORE",positive

"At the price of 31.5k this is the best laptop. Moreover we can upgrade RAM to 16 gb and ssd to 1 TB  making it futureproof. Performance is smooth. Only drawback is speaker is at bottom, hence sound is lower than expected. But its ok for me, as performance is priority. You can go for it if looking for laptop under 35 k.READ MORE",positive
