"Everything impressed me but the only catch with this laptop is, it doesn't has any ice cool technology which was one of the keynote of old Asus laptops which helps to keep the laptop cool even after long working hours. I don't know if the particular product gets heat easily or what. I had another Asus A-series previously which never gets hot as this laptop. So , moreover I would say it's getting heated so fastREAD MORE",negative

The looks and the feel is spot on thought the processor is a lit on the slower side but it is value for money..After a month of usage- the laptop starts in less than 9 secs which is commendable. It offers 3 fan speed mode for better performance and you would hear absolutely nothing even during heavy usage. The battery lasts about 5 hrs with backlight on and moderate usage which is a bit low but it's still absolutely worth it.READ MORE,positive
