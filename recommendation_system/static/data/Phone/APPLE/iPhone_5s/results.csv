This is the best phone available in the market and can't be compared with samsung or other android operating devices.

Phone not worth if ur buying in 2016. The iOS10 makes the phone super slow and it's not worth paying 20K. The phone is overpriced whereas you get good options at this price tag.

Most folk in India need an iPhone to flaunt. Without that you just haven't arrived. It is for this reason people buy and iPhone without understanding the consequences.1. Flipkart/WS retail maybe partially responsible for shipping out a faulty product. The same happens even when you buy from dedicated physical stores.

Nice phone. The best part of iPhone is that it never hangs. I had a bitter experience with Samsung. Then onwards I am loyal to iPhone.

Even premium devices of android hangs after one update. So go for it. Flipkart is the best in respect of delivery and return.READ MORE,positive

"This is the first time I've bought iOS based phone, I'm blown off with it's simplicity.. I have all my basic needs met. The features set is much lower when compared to Android phones you could get at this price, But it really depends on introspecting if you need such hardware and features. I would prefer to use simple, elegant phone with good battery backup.READ MORE",positive

Of course thanks to Flipkart for the discounted offer, and to WS Retail for delivered the product on a day. The only deterrent was that they were not delivering the product to Noida: And I had to get it delivered to a friend in Delhi.

My first apple phone is this one - Apple Iphone 5S (Space Grey).I purchased this phone in June 2015. I would say its a great experience switching over from Android to IOS. Flipkart offered the best price and compared to other retain stores it was 10k cheaper. The phone is running well with no lags whatsoever - true apple iphone experience delivered. Its a genuine apple product delivered by WS Retail.READ MORE,positive
"Awesome phone, Apple always make best phones. The compatibility between hardware and software in iPhones is superb which lacks in android. Specs compassion doesn't make any sense. The simplicity in iPhones are really cool. Apple don't build big features but really makes the smart features which is really useful in real time usage. The battery life is awesome. The finger printer sensor is really helpful. Camera is really nice. Build quality is superb.READ MORE",positive

"Haters gonna hate but i am writing this review after having used windows phone and android both. And in my opinion ios has been the best. For all those who support android for its ""Multi-functionality"" they must also be aware of its constant ""Hanging"". I hate to say but Android really disappointed me. I found Windows Phone way better and of course IOS to be really good. The biggest up is the updates which Apple provides for most of its phone on the market. And if you're using Android you can...READ MORE",negative
"Excellent phone and superb delivery from flipkart. Been using it for 5 months now and haven`t faced any issues. The only thing I feel is that if you are too much of an app user or takes lot of pictures from your phone, it`s better to go for 32GB model as at some point of time you will feel that you might run out of space.That being said, there are always softwares (including Icloud) wherein you can store/backup your stuff.READ MORE",positive

After using for 30days i'm writing my review :)Battery backup is awesome :) 15 hours guarantee even after using internet and listening music, making calls.And hardly it will take 40min to charge to 100% (that's the specialty of IOS)My overall rating for the product is 4.5/5  :DREAD MORE",positive

"Please do not buy Apple product or any phone from flipkart anymore. after spending so much , it results in disappointment. I got 5S and it was heating up like crazy.

"I am an Apple fan because of it's best hardware and software compatibility. Though specifications are not eye catching but those things are just meant to fool the customers .It has an 8MP camera better than 16 or 20MP of any other android phone. It has got just 1gb ram and a dual core processor but u cannot find a small lag in any of the high end games like Asphalt 8 , real racing , injustice etc..Even its front facetime hd camera (1.2 MP) is much 2 better than the 8 MP rear camera of many...READ MORE",positive
