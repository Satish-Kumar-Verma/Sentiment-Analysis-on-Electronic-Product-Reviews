"I ordered this last month and literally received it in 2-3 days.Its a little expensive but its definitely worth it. Its elegant,sleek,big and really fast.If your looking for a phone for all your office work or even for just playing games and messing around then phone is just perfect. I first decided to buy the 64gb one cause its very less expensive but then i decided to go for the 128gb one as i could store more amount games,movies,songs and music etcREAD MORE",positive

"Product is getting heated after using for more than half an hour continuously... Being a brand such kind of issue should never come.
