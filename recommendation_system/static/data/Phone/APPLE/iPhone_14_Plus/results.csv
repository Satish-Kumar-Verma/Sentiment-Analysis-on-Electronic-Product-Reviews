This is a power packed product considering the price. It comes with 33% more battery and 0.7 inches larger display than the base model. Camera is superb in terms of video recording(cinematic mode and normal mode of 4K format). It feels like iphone 14 pro max in hands from the front. A revolutionary product.READ MORE,positive

"The iPhone 14 Plus is without a doubt the most amazing phone I've ever had the pleasure of using. From the moment I first held it in my hand, I could tell that it was a truly special device. The build quality is exceptional, with a solid feel that leaves no doubt in your mind that you're holding a premium product.One of the first things that struck me about the iPhone 14 Plus was the screen. It's absolutely gorgeous, with bright colors and stunning detail that make everything from movies to...READ MORE",positive

Phone is ok. Sometimes back buton does not work and slight lag. Fot this cost we have better phones.As usual Flipkart exchange is a scam. I exchanged my oneplus 8 pro which was in pristine condition. It was promised for 20 k and thr exchange team tricked getting 4k from me . This is a big scam. Better to buy directly.READ MORE,negative

"Best iPhone yet.Coming from regular 13 (6.1 inches), I noticed some significant upgrade. It took me 10 days to fully get used to this new size which is not heavy. And now this plus feels so normal & actually perfect size for me üòÑ. For those wanting to try new stuff with iPhone, just get this size and its weight easily compensates for its large size (if that ever becomes an issue )Display : More vibrant with better Dynamic range than iPhone 13 (noticed this very quickly),ProMotion (I tried ...READ MORE",positive

"The phone is a beast in performance and camera is also quite good. Nothing beats it in terms of battery life. Charge it once and you have to go nuts to kill the battery in one day. Display is great. Was thinking of going for iphone 13 but the bigger screen,better battery, cinematic mode, and action mode on video just edged it.Also with the price cut this becomes all the more killer option than similar priced Android devicesREAD MORE",positive

"This is an absolute stunner from apple. Most hyped and controversial phone of 14 series. I am amazed with the battery life of this phone coz i heard iPhone have battery drain issues but this one gives me back of more than 2 days. With last 20% it stayed alive entire day. Refresh rate may be 60 hz but higher the refresh rate more the power consumption, this is why it beat 14 pro series in battery backup. More feature in camera video and photo than 13.

"The Iphone 14 plus is the best deal for the money!, it has the best battery backup in iphone lineup (used for 40 days now) and has one of the best camera setup! But if you're someone who wants optical zoom or distance photography please remember that it has only 5x zoom and it has a huge display and if you really like a bigger display the go for 14plus it may take some days for one to get handy with this phone.

"Everything else is good i am disappointed with the gaming performance, after playing Bgmi and Codm for 10-20 it heats up and drops fps like some low end android phone. I tried everything restored, updated, called customer service  they said everything if fine but it is not. Now i am going to visit service center and see what they do, will update if it gets fixed. Edit: it is working fine now  it just needed some days to calibrate and now its working superb.READ MORE",negative
