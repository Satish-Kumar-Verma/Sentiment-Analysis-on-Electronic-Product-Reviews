"I guess there are already so many reviews and feedback about the phone that most would know what the phone really is capable of.To me personally, I liked the Android operating system for the options/customization it allows at every point, nevertheless Apple products have their own standards and that way there is a little less to learn when compared to so many versions/variants of Android suites out there. I guess because of the standardization Apple follows the applications would certainly ...READ MORE",negative

"Been using the Iphone 6 for over a week now. Got it for 23K under the exchange offer. I'm loving the experience overall. Great phone for the price. Under 30K, this and oneplus3 are the best options.
