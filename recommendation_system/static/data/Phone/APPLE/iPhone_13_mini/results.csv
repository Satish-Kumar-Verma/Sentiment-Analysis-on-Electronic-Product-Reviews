If you like small phone then you can go for it with your eyes closed. I have upgraded from 12 mini Both the phones are same but the experience of running 13 Mini is different.  It gives premium feel. Battery backup is also good. The phone is very good. Performance is #1 üòçüòçREAD MORE,positive

Best in class. If looking for a handy and small size phone it's the best phone for you to look for. If you're using a big size phone then at first this phone might not feel good to you but after some days you'll get used to it. Don't worry it's worth it. Prefer to buy in saleREAD MORE,positive
"All rounder. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest it for gaming but for a tech savvy ‚Äòminimalist‚Äô this phone is too good. Excellent camera, too handy and a descent battery that can last for a whole day.Having an iPad mini too helps for all other activities and I‚Äôm happy to be in the Apple mini ecosystem so far!

"If you want a compact, easy-to-hold-and-use phone that doesn't compromise on performance at all (while giving you all-day battery life) - this is it. Couldn't be happier with my upgrade from the iPhone SE. I recommend using only up to 15W chargers if you want to avoid the phone becoming unusually warm when plugged in. Charge times are still excellent if you want to slip in a quick charge for 20-30 minutes. It should give you enough battery life for half a day.READ MORE",positive
"This phone is very small phone weight is 140 grams, this phone for me is secondary phone as I use fold 4 as primary , this phone camera is very good (focus )but even in diffrent modes (like vibrant , rich contrast , cool , warm )etc the photos remain so true to colour,  that you may look extremely real Battery Software wise it doesn't have much setting and options and flexibility like a android (OS of Samsung and vivo have incredible options to tweak according to your needs  especially its ...READ MORE",positive

"If you want a small phone with powerful performance and cameras with added brand value. This is the phone to go for. Trust me Its that good. It may not justify the pricing for many. But man Its apple. Over the last 3 years, They have not changed the camera sensors & still they are the most dependable balanced camera phones. Be it the main lens or ultra wide lens, they perform really well. Even 2x digital zoom here, produces very much usable and crisp shots. So you have money enough to afford ...READ MORE",positive

"Great phone indeed I personally love the smoothness and overall looks and feels. It feels reality premium and so far I have enjoyed the experience.

"The best one-hand usability phone you could find on the market IP 13 mini. Everything is perfect about this phone camera, display, speaker, lightweight design and the colour starlight. As I'm upgrading from IP SE 1 back in 2016 after six years so it's a huge upgrade for me. For those who are looking for a very compact phone, with a power pack performance then just go for it. Before it gets too late.READ MORE",positive

"Bought recently. It's a power packed compact device. Battery lasts one full day with mild use(scrolling,calls, taking few pictures etc) , the processor is a beast, handles everything u throw at it. But the main and probably only reason u want to buy this for its ultra compact size which feels great in the hands and ideal for one handed use. Camera is excellent for close and Normal range photography,not for Zoom photography. I really recommend u try this screen size once.READ MORE",positive

"(Writing this after a day of use) First iPhone. After using android phones for more than 7 years, this feels like a breath of fresh air. Got it for two reasons: small form factor and extended software support (5+ years). Would recommend this to anyone who wants a smaller phone and has money to spend. Got it from from flipkart within a dayREAD MORE",positive
"I needed a handy phone and the only available option was the mini line-up of iPhone (strange that only Apple thought about making a smaller phone where everyone else is making it bigger). My only reservation was about the battery life - but it‚Äôs not bad at all. I easily get about 7 hours of screen time on every 100% charge which last me whole day of normal use.If you are looking for a power packed phone with compact form factory, it‚Äôs the best option.READ MORE",positive

After one month of usage battery is good but if you are gonna use it with dual sim that is one e sim and one physical than believe me wait just hold on and get your self 13 pro because mini won‚Äôt be able to handle and you will hardly get 3 to 4 hours because it drains crazy on dual sim .READ MORE,negative

"Most powerful iPhone on budget,Why should buy? - If you have have less budget or have already got 1 iPhone pro or pro max but want something handy for office hours and travel or gym/ workouts/ jogging as a secondary phone.- If you dont need those 5 percent of pro bells and whistles like pro res/ Marco/ raw / flawless night mode.

"This is one of the best sized performance phones available in the market. Mobile phone by definition needs to be mobile and iphone 13 mini seems to be following the foundation principle! the best part is that there is no performance hit as compared to its expensive counterparts!
