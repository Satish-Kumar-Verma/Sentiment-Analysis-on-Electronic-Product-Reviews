"I had purchased this phone in October 2023, the delivery was awesomeüëè . I was also happy with the product but after using it for around 7 to 8 months say in June 2023, suddenly the screen became white, everything was functional(I was able to receive calls and and it was ringing as well) on phone but the screen is white completely. So I visited to Authorised Apple Customer Service Center, but after getting their response I was shocked, Initially I was assuming that since it is in warranty, ...READ MORE",negative

"It's not pro, it's 13 pro max.I switched from 6s to 13 pro max.Ultimate performance as expected bcz A15 bionic processor is at its best.Camera is just amazing as triple camera with sensor shift motion and night vision.Video recording in night mode with cinematic mode is just cute ever.Display:-Wooww as 120Hz is just super smooth, gives you ultimate gaming experience.

Amazing product. An absolute charm to use the 120hz refresh screen on an Apple device running ios 15. Battery life is superb. Powerful processor never slows down even on heavy tasks.  Only downside is the weight slightly heavy. Rest an amazing product from Apple.  Reliable service from Flipkart.READ MORE,positive

"Dont buy this iPhone model. I have bought 13 Pro Max in Dec2021. Recently I had updated to iOS 16.x.There is a big problem with this phone and its iOS version. With iOS 16.x, my phone display started flickering and after some time the display turned completely white. I had searched on the web, the same issue occurred in most of the 13PM models with iOS 16.x around the world. Now that the coverage has expired I have to pay the repair fee. I would not recommend this model to anyone. Please don...READ MORE",negative

"I would sum up my review with pros and cons.1. 120hz refresh rate really feels smooth and display is amazing.2. Very reliable in terms of overall hardware performance.3. From being an android user before , ios feels a lot better (not specific to phone)4. The battery life is a monster and surprisingly it will improve over time once the AI knows your usage, all optimisations will be put into place.5. Very reliable in terms of photography. It‚Äôs click and forget. Amazing auto focus. You can...READ MORE",positive

"I've never owned an iPhone and wanted to transition over after I heard about the spectacular battery life of the 13 Pro Max. I finally pulled the trigger and got it. Now coming to the phone, it's nothing short of amazing. It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it. If you're sceptical of getting the phone on Flipkart, don't be. It's a genuine iPhone and the open box delivery system is quite neatThe only down...READ MORE",positive
