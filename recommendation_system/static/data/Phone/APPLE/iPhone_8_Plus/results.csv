"I am the 1st Desi in Pune to hold iphone 8 Plus.If anyone is interested to know how the 8 Plus performs compared to the iphone 7.Camera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 7 and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 11 but pages pop really fast.

Also flipkart provide 4 Costers ( AppStore , itune etc) as a pre booking gift, which make the day of a Apple fan. Finally about phone if u r user of iPhone 6sP or 7P than u find no visual difference ( except glass back) so it looks like an old phone. Also iOS 11 is running on all these three sets.

My 4th iPhone and a great upgrade from my iPhone 6. I was on the fence regarding iPhone x vs the 8 plus. I did not think the face Id is evolved enough. I like this design and the home button is a subconscious click for me. I am happy with it. Camera is fantastic and the speed of operation is super fast.Lastly Flipkart delivered on the day of launch even though it was Navratri. Kudos to Santosh the delivery person who came and delivered.READ MORE,positive
"Well, first of all thanks a lot Flipkart for providing some of the greatest offers on iPhone 8 series. Moving further, i kinda feel proud to say that I am the first person in Punjab to hold an iPhone 8 plus.

"I switched from iPhone 5s to iPhone 8 plus, and believe me its worth it. Well I din't feel to upgrade from iPhone 5s earlier as you know the kind of quality Apple iPhones have that you don't have to upgrade unless you just can't resist from the new features of latest devices.I know the price wise its too much to spend on just a phone, but you know if you are here and reading my review this means you do want one.

"As good as the True Tone implementation is, I‚Äôm annoyed that Apple didn‚Äôt opt for full OLED across the entire range. Instead, it‚Äôs only the iPhone X that gets the better saturation and near-perfect blacks that come with an OLED panel.The iPhone X also has a much better contrast ratio (1,000,000:1 vs 1300:1) and offers ‚ÄòTrue HDR‚Äô. The iPhone 8 Plus can play back HDR (high dynamic range) movies from iTunes and content from Netflix, but they won‚Äôt look quite so rich and colourful. Still, watch...READ MORE",positive

"Hassle free on-time delivery, though I opted for a day early option available to receive the Phone before by paying 54/- more. Actual plus point remained finding best prices for Apple 8Plus across all platforms (stores and online) and surprisingly though price difference was substantial as compared to IWorld Price and also better as compared to other websites.On the whole absolutely satisfactory experience and highly recommended to fellow aspiring buyers.READ MORE",positive
