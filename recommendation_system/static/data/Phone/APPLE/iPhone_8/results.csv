"Front camera issues twice within 8 days of purchase. Selfie camera was not working and screen was going completely black. Apple service center attendants were not ready to accept my phone for repair also. Some how when I managed to convince them for the repair, they were warning us and said if there's anything regarding the liquid insertion they can not do anything about it.. very bad experience buying a phone on flipkart , i Wont recommend this to anyone. ratings are in minus.READ MORE",negative
DONT BUY ! ITS A REFURBISHED PRODUCTI had no way to find out till once the phone fell and the glass back broke - so i went to get it changed and once the phone was opened there were pen markings on the battery! I was appalled as I had paid a hefty price for this product last year when i bought it. The service engineer told me that this was definitely a refurbished phone and I shouldn't even trust the waterproof claims on it. Stay away buy from authorized Apple storesREAD MORE,negative

"Phone is really good .. this is better than apple iPhone XR. I have done lot of research before by this phone .. if you are an android user .. please ignore this review .. reason being that , there is no way any android phones can match the quality and speed of iPhone.. how expensive your android mobile can be .. there is no match  when it comes iPhone. Only issue is Flipkart taking their own time delivering orders.. they take somewhere between 5 to 10!days for the delivery !!READ MORE",positive

"People say, it is not worth to upgrade from iPhone 7 to 8, but there are a lot of reasons to upgrade. Battery life is huge improved. I had to charge my iPhone 7 every evening, but with iPhone 8 it last about 1.5 days ( mainly due to 10nm processor ) as there is no improvement on iPhone 7 running iOS 11.

"Excellent product but felt delivered from wrong hand. Bought this phone on exchange of product however the delivery person was so rude that they reduced the exchange product value diminished by 70%, which forced me to pay additional exchange value since i decided not return back with this last minute unexpected value.  I thought to put excellent review on iPhone 8 but the behaviour of ekart people felt me why to bought it from Flipkart.READ MORE",negative

"This phone is not meant for heavy user. Battery doesn't last very long. For normal light task, it can last you through a day and half which is appreciable. Performance is better than any of the latest android phone available in the market right now. Totally worth it. Got it for 33k without any discount applied.READ MORE",negative
