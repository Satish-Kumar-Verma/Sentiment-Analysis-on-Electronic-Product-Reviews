"I received this product today. Here is my 1.5 month use reviewPros- Display- Photo (but you need to make proper settinging)- Premium design and built- Battery seems good to my kind of useCons- Price is little high, keeping it around 22-25k would be great.- samsung is not giving any features with the switch app to get backup restored from other android devices except samsung and ios. You have to use third part apps.- Slightly bulky in design and slippery surface.- no inbox adapter ...READ MORE",negative

"The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option.P...READ MORE",positive

Using this phone since almost 3 months. And after I would say it's best phone at this price range.1. Camera quality is good on this phone. Details coming inside the photos are natural. 2. Battery backup is decent I would say not that much good but it's giving you good Battery backup. Also if you're using in power saving mood Battery draining is very low. 3. Charging time is good.4. When I played BGMI on this phone there is no lag and also we can play smooth graphics with extreme frame r...READ MORE,positive

Been using for a month* Display is the best* Speakers are too good. Best for multimedia usage  because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use. But          battery drain is there. Charging is on the slower side. * Phone heats while playing a medium game for 15 minutes and also after 30 minutes of continuous heavy usage.* Processor is okay-ish. Had felt some discomfort  here and there.* Camera too is okay-ish. After processing the image  quality certainly ...READ MORE,negative

"The product is good.Display is awesome. Camera is also good for the price. Battery could be improved. 5000mAh seems less for the phone. Power pack performance.Overall value for money.
