"Using the Galaxy F54 5G for more than 2 weeks now. For a casual user like me, with no gaming I'm really liking this device so far. The camera and display is top notch for me, you can check the shared camera samples. Battery is also pretty good. After using poco for 3 years I am loving the One UI experience so very much, already received a 1.1 gb OTA update. The only drawback for me is build quality, plastic frame and back is not really up to the mark and speaker would have been better as well.READ MORE",positive
"Excellent product but the price is high when compared with poco f5 5g. Otherwise a good product to buy.But after using for a week, I am observing the fast drain of battery with minimal usage which needs to be fixed.The camera is awesome and amazing  with beautiful and perfect OISREAD MORE",positive
