DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It is quiet heavy and screen is rough hence the user's finger doesn't slide smoothly.The software is very very poor.

"Don't buy this phone, it is a go version of android 11 that's why some of the apps will not work on this. It has some software issue like sometimes its status bar will not scroll down and it becomes hot after a few minutes of usage. Try to increase your budget and go for a good one, avoid this smartphone. In short, it's a trash.READ MORE",negative
