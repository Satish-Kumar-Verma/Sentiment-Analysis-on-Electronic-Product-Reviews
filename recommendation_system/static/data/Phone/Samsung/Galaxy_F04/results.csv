"F04 is a very basic Android phone and will easily suit anyone with normal usage like call, texts, UPI, normal tasks. Gamers shouldn't consider this phone. The battery lasts more than a day.

After more than a couple of week usage of my Galaxy F04 (SM-E045F/DS) 4GB-64GB. I can say it's Samsung's entry-level smartphone regarding its Price and Features. Here I list out my observations.1)This device use PLS LCD as Display Technology which is quite different from Other competitors (IPS LCD). PLS screens offer 15% more brightness which is true.2)There is FALSE TOUCH Problem especially when scrolling. Confused by the way the cause is due to One UI (software) or Touch Screen itself.

It's going to help in the long run, both RAM and ROM.Processor is not powerful. And it is expected for this price. It gets the job done. It's a 4G phone. And network reception is very good.
