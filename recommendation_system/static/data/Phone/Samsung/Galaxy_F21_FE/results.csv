"Upgraded to it from an ASUS ROG II. Lighter, smaller, better cam, readily available accessories etc. I like the fact that it has a plastic back, so no cracks when I drop the phone unlike the glass phones. One of the reasons I had to switch from the ROG since parts are difficult to come by. I slowly realised glass back is a huge disadvantage if you are someone who doesn't change phones often. Liking the Samsung One UI (combined with Nova7) more and more I use it. The battery life is not that ...READ MORE",positive
