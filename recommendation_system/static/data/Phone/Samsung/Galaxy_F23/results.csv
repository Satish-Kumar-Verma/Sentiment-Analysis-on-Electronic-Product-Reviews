Review After Using 5 Days:1. SD 750 works very well and give a very good performance2. Fingerprint Sensor is very quick and responsive3. Camera is not up to the mark. Many other devices in the same range perform very well comparatively.4. Charing adapter not provided in the box. Gives a bad impression. Although the device supports 25W.

"Really loved the colour of the phone, it gives a premium vibe. Considering the camera only 8mp,it is way better than the camera of any other brand providing around 20mp with effects. Samsung's camera does not uses extra powdery effect and keeps the face natural like you are viewing in a mirror. It has a feature to click selfies by showing the palm, and it clickc a pcture within 3 seconds. Apart from that there are many features and modes provided in the camera.

Please read if you are looking forward to buying this phone.1. The phone hangs on minimum apps installed.2. The battery dies quickly. This phone does not even last on standby.Maximum time it can work with screen on and calls is 60 minutes.3. It heats up a lot. Seems like it is not made for Indian conditions. The active cooling is a gimmick and doesn't work. Temperature go as high as 80 degrees. 4. There is no charger in the box. Which you already know. Avoid this phone and save your m...READ MORE,negative
"After a lot's of research in mid range mobiles I saw this f23. I bought this mobile and I am really very happy after buying this. Camera quality is very good, RAM is excellent (6gb), I have also got 128 gb internal storage. The sensors are working really so good. I love all the sensors of this mobile, finger print scanner in lock screen etc etc. Touch is very smooth and comfortable to type and slide. Battery backup is awesome. Overall at this price in 16k range I got a features of above 30k m...READ MORE",positive

"I'm using this mobile from 2days. Overall experience is not good as brand name. But main issue is with battery. Battery is draining very fast if you are using 5G. If you charge mobile to 90% at morning 9am, by 4pm it will be 20% only for normal use. If we play games then it will drain more faster. And i found network issue also. Im not sure that the issue will be in all mobiles or only in this mobile. When we using 5g suddenly network will drop to 4g when we we get calls. After finishing call...READ MORE",negative

Good performance(Not for gamers though)Cons:1. Should've gone with an AMOLED screen.2. Single speaker is not that loud.3. No charger (the cable which they provide is Type C to C, not Type A to Type C.

"Do not have high expectations from this phone by looking at its specifications, Samsung phones have an inner tendency to HANG for no reason ! Even though they claim to put in the best processors and maximise RAM and ROM. I hope they learn something from One Plus and Vivo.

"Butter smooth performance. Color is too good than the image shown in Flipkart (I have purchased Aqua blue color).Only one CONS: Battery. It is 5000 mah. But it lasts less than 24 hours! I have used Samsung M20 in the past. That also consists of 5000 mah battery. After 3 and half years of usage, it still gives battery backup upto 24 hours. In F23, display size is slightly large. It whould be better if Samsung gives minimum 6000mah battery.Disappointed with the battery.READ MORE",negative
