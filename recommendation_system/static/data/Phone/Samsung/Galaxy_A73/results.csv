"An excellent quality mid range flagship phone üì± from Samsung, the A 73 5 G is all ready for when 5G networks are introduced in the country, great camera set up , super software, very light weight, great 8 GB RAM and 256 ROM stores all my data,  all in all a great phone from the house of Samsung, great display, and even dust and water üíß resistant. A super duper buy all in all respects.READ MORE",positive
"Its a great phone with good battery life and smooth performance. Its price is 5k to 6k more , considering No charger , No screen guard , no Back cover, no earphones.Software experience is also very good and  One UI feels matured now with Android 12. (I have last used Noe 10)Just started using but seems can use this for a long time.READ MORE",positive

First thing first Flipkart delivery  killed my excitement completely. Delivery almost took one week from purchase.But mobile is awesome.. OneUI awesome.  Camera good need to test further. And those 4 years of android update  keep this phone way ahead of competition.READ MORE,positive
"It's nice phone with loaded feature. Awesome large screen.nice sound.It's awesome performer also. 2 things worth noticing.Front camera has color shift,it doesn't produce accurate color like back camera.( Click same pic with both camera and check the difference)Other thing which is most annoying.OS has Ad ,which was not expecting at this price range.its ruins the clean experienceREAD MORE",negative

"If I have to sum up this phone in one word, it would be - classy. Great performance, good camera, incredible battery, wondrous screen and sleek looks. In display fingerprint reader is cool. I got a 45 W Samsung charger, which charges from 15% battery to 75% in about 40 minutes. It could be better, but I guess it helps prolong battery life. The promise of 4 years of Android OS upgrades is a dream come true. The just wish it still had the 3.5mm jack.Edit: I got the Galaxy Buds Live for Rs. 499...READ MORE",positive

One of the best mobile for heavy and normal usage. Camera is on point and display os damn good and battery backup with normal usage stays around one day almost with 60hz refresh rate and with 120hz refresh rate it goes upto 15 to 17hrs. Also keeping noted please buy back cover with hard materia which protects back pannel. Because its a matte finish... I will suggest Kappa Back cover with camera protection. In simple words one of the best mobile.READ MORE,positive
Camera is awesome.. Display is too good... battery backup is also good... Performance is good... finger print scanner is fast..Only downside is should have included charger along with the mobile for this price range...READ MORE,positive

"Compared to other phones like Motorola who offer the same specs with bloat free software, this phone is over priced. There is a lot of adds and bloatware in Samsung UI. Otherwise the build of the phone seems nice and sturdy. The camera does a good job. Another minus point of the phone is that even after paying so much money, it comes without a charger, phone cover etc. At least they could have given a converter for C Type to 3.5 mm jack for headphones.READ MORE",negative

Experience with this product is not good ..I am not expecting such a bad product in this range. No more shopping from flipkart from now onwards...battery is working just like 1000 mah....fake details about product.READ MORE,negative
Camera was the highlight of this phone but I hated it. Low light photos are very bad seems like any cheep Camera phone. Doesn't look like 108mp camera.  I was using one plus 7t before which was one of the best but switched to Samsung A73 just because the camera reviews were very good. Very disappointed with this phone. Also requested flip flipkart for return but was not accepted by them.READ MORE,negative
