Excellent mobile whe you upgrade after 2 or 3 years from Android phone. Overall worth for the price.  Digital well-being feature is awesome but my old phone automatically shutdown on the set time. This one feature is missing in this phone. Instead it makes the screen black and white.  After all there is an option to turn this off.  When the phone is off there is no quick option to operate mobile and hence makes the mind to goto sleep.READ MORE,positive
