"It might not have the wow factor of the Galaxy S22 Ultra, but don't make the mistake of overlooking the Galaxy S22 Plus.

"Superb üòÅExcellent üòÅ. My first Samsung Android phone. Many who sounds much about less battery backup, my suggestion is to be updated with latest OS version and you set the refresh rate as 60hz. No need to use 120hz, because 60hz is enough with snapdragon 8gen1.

"Initially i was ready to buy iphone 13. But after watching reviews and all, i think this is an upgrade over iphone. Perfect product in Android lineup. No nonsense device with a lot to offer than an iPhone at this price range. Perfect camera. Awesome screen quality. Awesome performance, sound quality. Added customisation in OneUI. Overall nothing left to complain. Attaching some photos sample for camera quality check. Just look at the color science.READ MORE",positive
"Ordered on 23rd September, received a day prior than estimated. Thanks to timely delivery by Flipkart. Coming to the smartphone itself, the device is a perfect all-rounder with a beautiful display and exceptional set of cameras.

A Masterpiece will be a underranked statement when it comes to this phone. The premium feel that it gives is beyond anything. Full metal frame with brightest yet samsung display is the best in class.

"It is the best flagship phone, believe me it gives full competition to iPhone 13 in every aspect. It has the best camera set-up and screen resolution. The S22+ performs smoothly, I haven't faced any lags till now. Battery back-up is also great (after the first few updates), it last 1 day easily for me.READ MORE",positive

"This is my first flagship. Phone's good. Takes excellent photos especially in low light (the image of the tree has been clicked at 8:25 pm). They say don't go for the megapixels, go for the focal length (that's true). Gets charged from 17% to 100% in half an hour with a 25 watt charger.READ MORE",positive

"Don't waste your money, totally disappointed after purchase this,very bad deal, battery drains very fast, you can use only half day without heavy calling or chatting, heating issue, I have two phones vivo z1x and s22+ Vivo z1x is 2018 model, if I compare both, battery backup are same of both phones, totally unsatisfied from Samsung,If you are camera lover then you can go for this otherwise so many options available in the market at that price.READ MORE",negative

A Masterpiece will be a underranked statement when it comes to this phone. The premium feel that it gives is beyond anything. Full metal frame with brightest yet samsung display is the best in class. Topped with SD 8 gen 1 performance is just a cheery on the top. You all probably know how well S series camera is still I would say that the wonders that this telephoto lens can do is mesmerizing to eyes. I have compared it with Iphone 13 pro camera and both are same level noone is winner. Both ...READ MORE,positive

"The best smartphone I've owned till date. It has one of the best display in a smartphone at the time. The camera performs excellent. I really loved the camera of this smartphone. I'm getting a screen on time of 7 hours, which is outstanding battery performance for a flagship. The overall build of this phone is just too good, way more comfortable to hold and use it. So the overall experience is excellent. I would recommend anyone to go for it.READ MORE",positive

"The display is crisp and for people who were expecting a 2k screen, 1080p+ is more than enough for a mobile phone.Cameras are very good (don't compare it with the ultra, there is a price difference for a reason).The 3x telephoto works well and the colour shift is very less when we switch between lenses.It does heats up a little while using camera for longer duration but it's not much of a problem.Battery backup is also good. For moderate usage it lasts a day easily. But if you wish to do ...READ MORE",positive
