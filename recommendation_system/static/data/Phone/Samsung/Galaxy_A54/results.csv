"Disappointment from Samsung. A 40k smartphone lacks in comparison as per performance. Design is good , battery is ok, but struggled in terms of performance. Can handle the day to day life easily but for heavy task Exynos failed. They can easily provide Snapdragon but every time this Exynos chip has broken my heart. As though I am a die hurt fan of Samsung still I hv to say not satisfied with the Exynos chip..READ MORE",negative
