The phone is much more then expected. Samsung has done a great job and improved the device experience. Price seemed very high however after using it for more than 1 month I would say It is worthy on this price as you get a lot of features that you won't get on any other phones of this price band. I would give 10 out of 10 to Samsung's OneUI user interface. Believe me it's the best phone I have ever had.READ MORE,positive

"The phone has a prremium feel no doubt, but the c type earphone jack situation is just a tafd saddening. The phone has awkward glitches at times but feels solid to the hand, a bit heavy really, with a cover. But looks great. Will update the camera review once I have tested out everything with pictures.READ MORE",negative
"Its is a good phone, with very smooth screen scrolling and many cool features.  Still exploring the camera features.  The only difference I feel from my old Galaxy is the volume of ringtone is lesser.  In noisy surroundings, if the phone is in my bag, I can hardly hear the ringtone.READ MORE",positive
