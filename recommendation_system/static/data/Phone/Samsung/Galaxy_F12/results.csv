"Using the phone for the last 1 year.‚Ä¢The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me. ‚Ä¢I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good. ‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.‚Ä¢ Overall, I love this phone. No complains.READ MORE",positive

It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough.

I'm writing this review after 4 days of using this phone. According to the price this phone is excellent. Battery life is amazing. Lasts about 2 days after charging. Display is good.

Review after 3 month of use:1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/52)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/53) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/54)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese .

The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUIREAD MORE,positive
