"It's very fast as expected. Overall performance is also good. I'm using this mobile for the last one week. Display is fantastic. But one drawback is battery drainage. The battery is going down a little bit faster as compared to the new handset. After full charging, it lasts for a maximum of 2 days. Charging is fast. It supports flash charging. My overall experience is good with this handset.READ MORE",positive
