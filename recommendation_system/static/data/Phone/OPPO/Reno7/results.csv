"If Oppo can improve the battery power a little. Then It will be a perfect product. Even though now, It's performance is also great.As I bought this product just yesterday.

"After using this phone for 4 days i can say that this phone is superb, much better than redmi or Samsung phone s in this range. My last phone was redmi note 7 pro which has sony imx sensor. This phone also has sony sensors so the quality of the image is amazing. Night mode, macro mode, zoom mode, portrait mode all are almost accurate.Display is fine, although it has only one speaker but sound quality is much good and loud, although it has 4500 mAh battery but the charge lasts for almost two ...READ MORE",positive

Friends  I have used Oppo Reno 7 k for around 10 days. My point wise review is as follows.1) Performance is good ..I have not seen any frame drops while playing COD mobile at Max frame rates. Also there is no heating issue.2) Battery backup is really good. It gave me approximate 7-8 hrs of screen on time. With the fast charger given in box it charges very fast approx in half an hour. 3) Back camera is good. It can capture good images. Video stabilisation is ok at 30 FPS full Hd.
