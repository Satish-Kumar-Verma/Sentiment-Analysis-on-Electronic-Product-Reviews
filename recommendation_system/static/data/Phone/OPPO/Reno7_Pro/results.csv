"Finally Oppo made a smarter which is completely balanced in all aspects. Oppo Reno 7 Pro 5G is a no doubt a camera focused device. The Sony censor works wonder along with AI color detection and give you DSLR like photos in all light condition. Performance wise it is a much more faster than any other phone.

I upgraded from Reno 5 pro to Reno 7 pro.. and I feel its worth upgrading. Though I am missing curved edges but its fine; its sleek design impresses me too! Air gesture feature is missing as told in Launch event, I hope to see that in this may be by an OTA Update soon!! Battery backup is average to good.

The display of Reno 6 Pro with curved glass was far more superior than this phone which has an outdated flat screen design. The phone is having brick-like design similar to Apple phones.
