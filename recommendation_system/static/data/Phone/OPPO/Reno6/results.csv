Very bad experience with this product. And now it is my problem not a flipkart or a oppo problem since the date for returning has just passed by a day. This is so amazing Flipkart can only lure and excite you for offers on the products but cannot do anything if you get a wrong one. FANTASTIC.READ MORE,negative

I got a very good deal on this phone (11.7k !! With exchange) .A refreshing upgrade from op7. Nothing much to complain on day to day use except average battery backup (65W fast charging compensates for that though. Its insanely fast as compared to 25W dash charger) . Only down firing speakers available which may seem odd if you are switching from stereo speaker phones. I love the design and thats its USP. Camera is good and loaded with crazy features ( mostly processing) which i am yet to exp...READ MORE,positive

"I received the phone 11 days after ordering, which was not good on Flipkart's part. The phone design is very good and it's width would be good for someone with smaller hands. Display is brighter than phones of other brands, and is visible even in direct sunlight. Sound with its single speaker is not great but manageable for phone calls. Sound on headphone and Tws with Atmos is good. The metal frame and frosted glass back are awesome and look beautiful even through the provided case. Sensors w...READ MORE",positive
