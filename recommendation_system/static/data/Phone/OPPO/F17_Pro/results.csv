The things I like:Phone looks Premium.Camera is Decent.AI mode is helpful.Portrait mode has many features.Videography Excellent..Support Video Background Blur in both front and rear camera.Google Camera is supported.Memory management is good.Nothing is bad in this mobile but need improvement in camera.Exposure is very high which makes image whitish. OPPO should work on more free  themes. Quality of the free themes are not good..Check the images attached.READ MORE,negative

The battery gets charged from 15% to 85% in 25 minutes flat.... 4015 mAH battery is a little less, but still compensated by fast charging facility.Face recognition unlock, two apps open at a time, rolling screenshots etc., are additional features....

Bad mobileREAD MORE,negative
Front camera is not up to the mark but back camera is awesome. But overall performance is Ok. Fast charging options is the best. Processor performance is fine but sometimes phone got hanged due multiple app running at the same time. In this case you need to close all the app and reopen.READ MORE,negative

It's good compact phone and display is good obviously because it's Amoled but for today I won't recommend this phone as older processer and it comes with 4g with 4000 mah battery which is nowhere enough for today. Processor is Helio G95 and it's based on 12 nm architecture. It's too much power consuming so please don't buy. You can go for Redmi or poco m4pro or m4pro 5g. They are best in segmentREAD MORE,negative
