"My honest review. If you are looking for excellent display , sound , daylight photography, pls go for it. Gaming part is pretty average compairing with sd 730. But it is value for money product due to the premium look, dolby Atmos , video playback, decent graphics for gaming. And the company claims that it can do much better in 108 mp output but I cannot able to see the difference between 64 MP and 108 image processing. And zooming is noisy after 10x.READ MORE",negative

Well it was great on time delivery of the device by flipkart. This device is value for money but the reason I bought this particular device is it's camera.After been using this device for a month I am giving an honest review.The hype of the camera is not real. 10x zoom isn't the best and portrait gives fake depth and bookeh.Display and battery is perfect.READ MORE,negative
Hi guys I bought this phone 1 week ago. Till now it's working fine. Camera is superb and way much better than one plus yes you read it right. The only flaw is that pictures are not that good in night. Camera clicks amazing in day light outside home. Ultra steady mode is superb and also 20x. Battery is decent works for a 1 day when used after full charge. Fast charging is really nice. Within 20 minutes it touches 70%. Phone is quite fast in processing. Screen and display is really good.
