Will never buy any product from Flipkart as they mention a wrong commitment about the cash back. Customer care executive are also fraud and they take you round and round after I tried to clear doubt. Top 10 Mobile shop is the best as they give all the clarity about their mobile product and offers.Biggest mistake of my life wherein I thought to buy from FlipkartREAD MORE,negative
Got it a week ago.. running smoothly.No heating while playing high end games.. camera is just wow.. need some improvement in selfie part but it's fine as compared to others.. oppo build quality is also different.. phone fell many times from child's hand but no damages at all.. it's night AI video is awesome.. AI feature is also the best in all.. 1st is 2x zoom2nd is 5x zoom3rd is AI night pic.. zoom the pic and pixels are as it is.READ MORE,positive

The only reason I am giving this a single star is because of the call recording issue. I don't understand why Google has started this feature of informing both the parties about call recording. That means under any unwelcome circumstances this call recording can not be used as an evidence. If a person can not use it as an evidence when required then what is the benifit of having this feature?READ MORE,negative
