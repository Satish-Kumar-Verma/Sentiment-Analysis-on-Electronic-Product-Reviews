"1. The Oppo Reno 10 5G is an excellent smartphone that lives up to its claims. The display is simply gorgeous, and the 5G connectivity is super-fast.2. The zoom capability is remarkable, and the photographs are sharp and colorful.3. This phone has an excellent battery life. I don't have to worry about running out of battery while using it all day, and the rapid charging capability allows me to easily top it off when necessary.4. The Oppo Reno 10 5G has a streamlined, elegant look. The U...READ MORE",positive

The phone is good however after using for 2 days what I feel is one of major drawback of this phone is the battery life. Battery is draining fast even after applying all the necessary optimization. Even I compared it with my Reno 5 pro battery which is far better than Reno 10. Plus Reno 5 charg d much faster than Reno 10? Not sure why. This aspect should have been looked into.READ MORE,negative

Ok so after spending around 4 days with this phone I would say its okay phone considering the price. -Camera: Its not upto the hype they are creating. Camera is average.

With medium uses it will last you for a day hardly .Performance: if your a heavy gamer. Avoid buying this phone. Its somethi...READ MORE,negative
I have upgraded from oppo Reno 8 5g to Oppo Reno 10 5g and It is worth upgrading.1. The design language is quite attractive and the phone is lightweight while offering a solid build.2. It has vibrant AMOLED display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.3. The phone's battery life is a much-needed upgrade over the Reno8 and will easily take you through a day and then some.4. Light weight and Decent stereo speakers.5. It has IR blaster and that is a very cool feature to have now a days.6. The...READ MORE,positive
