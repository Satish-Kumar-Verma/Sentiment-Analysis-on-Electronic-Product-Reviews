"I gifted this brand new phone to my wife and she liked it. The best part is ,its design and features,fast charging, light weight.etc. If we talk about camera it's awesome 108 mp Rear camera and front 32 mp. Plus we don't need to install extra applications for filtering and editing images, We get many options in the Camera settings itself. Go for it. üëçREAD MORE",positive

So here is my honest review after using this phone for 10 hours.Display quality is more than awesome. Curve Display is giving premium touch to this phone Sound quality is also goodFast charging is superb Camera quality is just average in this price. It could be better in this price Backside is neither metallic nor having glass. It is not giving premium feel from Backside.So I am giving 4 * out of 5 to this phone.READ MORE,positive

"OVER PRICED :-- Display not that curved. Very slightly curved.- CAMERA is hit or miss. Sometimes it  takes good photos, most of the time it takes pretty ordinary photos. Colours way off.- Video stabilization on EIS is not that great.- Low light photos are not good.- Sometimes lags.+ Sound is loud and decent.+ Good for content watching.+ Call quality decent.+ All 5G bands All in all this phone didn't meet my expectations.READ MORE",negative

My honest review to all who is looking to buy this mobile. Don't waste your money buying this mobile. Camera is very worst. It's calim that it's have 32 megapixel from camera where as the quality getting of 2mp camera. Back camera have same issue quality is as poor as 4-10 mp. Very high price for this specifications I realized after buying. Don't buy it at all guys. Look for some other instead of this.READ MORE,negative

"Only one question to Oppo What is the use of 108 MP camera without clarity on pics, can't compete even with regular mid budget phones,Display and battery having decent score Overall usage is fine apart from camera qualityREAD MORE",negative

"Premium looks, Sleek, light weight, curved display adds to the beauty. Amazing sound, one will enjoy the dual speaker soround sound. Battery charging is really fast. backup is OK. But, camera performance is not as expected from Reno series. My Reno 3pro still gives better outcome. 108MP is just a marketing gimmick. Snapdragon processor feels slow as wellREAD MORE",positive
Camera quality is not good even not as 108 mega pixcel. If i spent 30k then camera quality should be extra ordinary. Reno 8 5G is good product in this amount range .this product should be 15k-20k range.Bettery backup also very low. Totally disappointedüò≠READ MORE,negative

The design was very good and it gives a premium feel in your hands. On a single charge for normal usage like calling and browsing social media the battery will last easily for a day. For the people who are looking for high performance phones and gaming this phone is not worthy. The camera quality is not that bad but ok and the speakers are very nice.Overall a nice phone for daily usage with superb design and display quality.READ MORE,positive
