"Great value for money! I've been using this mobile from last 3 months and I am very much impressed with it's performance, battery life and hardware.Few things i like about one plus 7 are:1. Camera quality is very good. Even when you zoom in, the pixels and clarity of the image remain same.2. Good display and sound, it offers Stereo speakers on top and bottom which gives you a Stereo effect while watching movies or videos. It comes with Dolby surround sound :) 3. It is really fast and ...READ MORE",positive

Using since November 2019. No lags or any complaints as my only expectation was long term support for the latest processor. Camera perfomance is awsome in its own way. Battery lasts a day with dual 4G mode on and moderate usage.Heats up while charging (since its dash charging) and while using under sunlight. I use an extra fan while charging to avoid the extra heat which will increase phones life. Avoid chariging and using the phone.Charging time is fast . Like 20-90 % before i finish...READ MORE,positive

"I bought this product from Flipkart and feeling confused  about this phone. When i unboxed it, i found it in very dusty condition, also there was tempered glass already found on screen.

"Loved the phone.Excellent screen, gorgeous camera and a stunning design. All packed into a slim body with a beast of a performance.However, the only problem so far after 10 days of use is that the sound earpiece is located slightly on the right, and not in the middle, so the voice level during calls vary when you use your right and left ear.I contacted OnePlus for this issue, and they claimed it to be a design flaw.One more thing that I would like to inform prospective buyers is that do ...READ MORE",positive

I didnt like the UI of Samsung and Redmi so that was not in my list either.My budget was 31k so considering the price of iPhones I could only afford a 2016 model iPhone which is iPhone 7 plus.After a hell lot of research understood that these two phones ie, iPhone 7 plus and one plus 7 can't be compared.
