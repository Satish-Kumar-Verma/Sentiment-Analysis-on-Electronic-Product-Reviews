I'm fully satisfied with1. Camera clarity. 2. Display n performance is like Butter üßà3. Speaker is also loud n clear compare to any other phones.4. Design - Lightweght 5. Charging is very fast.Only thing is Battery need to be 6000mah atleast .Still 5000mah is good for daily use. As it is charging very fast no need to worry. I give 4.5/5*READ MORE,positive
