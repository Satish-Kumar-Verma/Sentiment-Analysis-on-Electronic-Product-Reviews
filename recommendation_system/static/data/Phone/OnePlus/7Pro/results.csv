The delivery of the product was very fast. The phone is very solid built and the screen is amazing.my previous phone was poco F1 it was a good and value for money phone but was not premium .So I decided to use Oxygen Os instead of MIUI . THE OPERATING SYSTEM MAKES THIS PHONE A MASTERPIECE. EVERYTHING IN THIS PHONE IS PERFECT EXCEPT ITS BATTERY. BATTERY OF THIS PHONE SHOULD BE 6000 MAH BECAUSE  ITS WONDERFUL DISPLAY CONSUME BATTERY VERY QUICKLY. I USED THIS PHONE FOR ONE DAY AND THAT WAS ENOUG...READ MORE,positive
The camera needs to be better optamized. I was using a note 9 and for some reason the camera on this device feels a notch below. Tried the Google camera apk as well. This has slight improvements but the images do come out a bit warmer and some of the colours seems washed out. Apart from this the phone is fantastic. I absolutely love the screen to body ratio. But a big downside is a lack of a headphone jack. But really happy with my purchase and looking forward for the one plus 8READ MORE,positive

"All features are working fine, even flipkart delivered at time but the problem was when new phone opened and set up it was showing ""Android system was stoped"" it was not letting me to go at main screen. The setup wizard was fully corrupted, hence I thought to replace the phone. Finally I visited to nearest mobile shop, they said need to flash on mobile software so that you can jump on main screen. They charged me 450 rupees to do needful and phone started. My heartbeat was too fast as I pai...READ MORE",negative

There are other phones with similar or even better specs at a price point lower than this for ex realme x2 pro and iqoo 3 but the only reason I bought it was the os. If th3 operating system doesn't matter to you then you are better off with an iqoo 3 or realme x2 proREAD MORE,negative

I love everything about this phone but there is some minor problems like the front video doesn't have the mirror mode option.
