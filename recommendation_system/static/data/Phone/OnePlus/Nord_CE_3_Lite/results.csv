Product is overall good at this price range. But little bit disappointed by device overall size now days... Phones are getting bigger.. i've asked from many of my friends.. they all said that..they want compact phones in budget segment..and mine pov is also same..overall weight management has been done well.. phone feels good at the time of usage and portability.READ MORE,negative
