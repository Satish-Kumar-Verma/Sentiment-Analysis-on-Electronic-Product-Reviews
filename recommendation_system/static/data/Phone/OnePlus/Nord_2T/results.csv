I am using  this device  from 2 month and over all experience is good . When you click photo it will stuck for few seconds. And it start heating  when using it more than 1 hour . The phone display is not much big from others phone at this price . And the lights at the back  one is dummy only it is only for look . Display of this phone is very smooth. The back of this phone is glass so it look premium 😍READ MORE,negative
