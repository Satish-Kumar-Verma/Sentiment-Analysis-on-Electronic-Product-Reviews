"Battery drainage issues is most worst thing of this OnePlus 10R phone. Please fix this battery drainage issues, Oneplus as soon as Possible because at this price segment with 5000 mAh is not giving a reasonable battery backup. In a minute it drain one percent repeatedly. I'm doing all remedies, i,e. ON power saving mode but the results are same.
