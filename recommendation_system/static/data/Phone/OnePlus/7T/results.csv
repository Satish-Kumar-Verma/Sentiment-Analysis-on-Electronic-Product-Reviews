Just received.. was confused btwn 7t and 8... But there is no much difference rather than the 855+ for 7t and 860 sd for 8... Totally satisfied... The flat screen is a much user friendly surface than the curved displays.. the 90hz refresh makes a very noticable difference as I was a 60hz user before .. the camera is the best ..  for gamers I think you should probably go for it... Even though 7t has a 3800 mAh battery(which seems a bit small) but the superfast warp charging does the job in hal...READ MORE,positive

"Writing this review after 3 years, and it's just not as good anymore. The software updates ruined it.

"Bought this phone when the 8 and 8 pro had just released. No regrets. The 7T is fast, but I did see some bugs like how Android phones usually have. Pros: Nice camera, dual speakers and audioCons: No water resistance rating, screen automatic brightness is not tuned well and the phone gets too dark at times, I used Android auto a lot and it is just hopeless compared to Apple carplay.READ MORE",negative
