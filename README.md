# Sentiment Analysis on Electronic Product Reviews

## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on electronic product reviews scraped from **Flipkart**. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative, and based on this, a recommendation system is developed that displays the percentage of positive and negative reviews for various products. This helps potential buyers make informed decisions when purchasing products.

## Features
- **Review Scraping**: Automated scraping of product reviews from Flipkart.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of the review data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of the reviews as positive or negative.
- **Recommendation System**: Displays the positive and negative review percentages for each product to help users make purchasing decisions.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Tailwind CSS
  - JavaScript
- **Backend**:
  - Python Django
  - SQLite3 (Database)
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis
  - Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn

## Project Architecture
1. **Web Scraping**: Collects product reviews data from Flipkart.
2. **Preprocessing**: Prepares the scraped data by cleaning, tokenizing, and converting it into a format suitable for the machine learning model.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Applies a machine learning classifier to predict the sentiment of each review.
   - Classifies the reviews into positive or negative categories.
4. **Recommendation System**: Calculates the percentage of positive and negative reviews for each product and displays it to the users.
5. **User Interface**: Presents the reviews and sentiment analysis results in a clean, user-friendly interface.
